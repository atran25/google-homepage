This is The Odin Project's first assignment which is to recreate the google homepage
Demo: https://atran25.github.io/google-homepage/

After thoughts:\n
Project still has some problems with uneven spacing and I noticed after finishing how different it looks on other browsers, but overall I'm very happy with the result. I was able to add most of what I thought to be the difficult features, such as the image inside the search bar. I will likely come back to this project in the future and redo it with the new skills I will have at the time.
